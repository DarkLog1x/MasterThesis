# Masters Thesis Repo

This is the main repo for my Masters thesis. This contains all of the code and papers that have been used thought my work. If one is interested in just to code portions all of this can be found in the **code** folder. There is a *readme.md* file there that describes the code. Putting the code in its own repo is on its way!
