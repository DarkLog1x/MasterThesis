#This is a config file
#It needs to be filled out similer to the output of the script that is run (a.k.a - NMAP, ssh_scan, etc)
#* special case to print all other open port todo: this is a hack to get all open ports of machiens to print needs to be fixed
ports: 22 - open
ports: 80 - closed
ports: 443 - closed
ports: 5000 - closed
ports: 6000 - closed
IP: ip_external_auth - publickey
IP: ip_internal_auth - publickey
#os version is a guess in nmap therefor this will mostly not work
#OS - linux 4.4
#for services one must fill out in the way that nmap should return them
#service: (name of service) on port (port number) is version: - (this must be taken form an nmap scan)
services: OpenSSH on port 22 is version: - 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.1
#should only be 22 and 5000
