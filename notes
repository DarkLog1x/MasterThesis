trifecat of things:
First create a document for what the vms should be doing. example: ssh is on port 222 and public/private keys only
Secound implement a VM that would be working on scanning ports, getting logs, etc. making sure that the doccuemntation is beeing floowed. If not email someone!
Third implement a low level KVM hook to do systemtap on vms and see what they are doing when running!
